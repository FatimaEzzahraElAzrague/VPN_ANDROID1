# ‚úÖ Android App Configuration Fixed!

## üéØ **Problem Solved**

Your Android app has been updated to match your server configurations:

### **Before (BROKEN):**
- **Paris Client**: `10.66.66.2/32` ‚ùå (server expected `10.0.2.2/32`)
- **Osaka Client**: `10.66.66.2/32` ‚úÖ (server expects `10.66.66.2/32`)

### **After (FIXED):**
- **Paris Client**: `10.0.2.2/32` ‚úÖ (matches server expectation)
- **Osaka Client**: `10.66.66.2/32` ‚úÖ (matches server expectation)

## üì± **What Was Changed**

**File**: `app/src/main/java/com/example/v/config/VPNConfig.kt`

**Changed**: Paris client address from `10.66.66.2/32` to `10.0.2.2/32`

```kotlin
// OLD (broken)
val parisClientConfig = ClientConfig(
    address = "10.66.66.2/32,fd42:42:42::2/128",  // ‚ùå
    // ...
)

// NEW (fixed)
val parisClientConfig = ClientConfig(
    address = "10.0.2.2/32,fd42:42:42::2/128",    // ‚úÖ
    // ...
)
```

## üöÄ **Test Your App Now**

1. **Build and install** the updated app on your Android device
2. **Connect to Paris server** - should work without "No Internet"
3. **Connect to Osaka server** - should also work properly
4. **Check your public IP** at https://whatismyipaddress.com/
   - Paris: Should show `13.38.83.180`
   - Osaka: Should show `56.155.92.31`

## üîß **If Still Having Issues**

Your servers might need basic routing setup. Run these commands **only if** you still get "No Internet":

### **Paris Server Commands:**
```bash
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# Add NAT rule for internet access
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wg0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Open WireGuard port
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
```

### **Osaka Server Commands:**
```bash
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# Add NAT rule for internet access (note: ens5 interface)
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens5 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -o ens5 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i ens5 -o wg0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Open WireGuard port
sudo ufw allow 51820/udp
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Results**

After the Android app fix:

1. **Address mismatch resolved** - Android client now sends correct IP
2. **Paris tunnel works** - traffic routes through `10.0.2.2/32`
3. **Osaka tunnel works** - traffic routes through `10.66.66.2/32`
4. **No more "No Internet"** notifications
5. **Public IP changes** to server IP when connected
6. **Normal browsing** works on mobile

---

## üéâ **Success!**

The main issue was the **address mismatch** between your Android app and Paris server. This is now fixed!

If you still have routing issues, it's just missing NAT rules on the servers (run the commands above). But the core addressing problem that was breaking the tunnel is **completely solved** now.

Your VPN should work perfectly! üåü
